## SpreadJS Designer Component

For complete information on how you can customize the Designer, refer to our online documentation - https://www.grapecity.com/spreadjs/docs/v14/online/spreadjs_designer_components.html

### Description
The SpreadJS Designer Component is a control that can be embedded into your web application easily.  It also provides a flexible, customizable configuration to achieve your business logic.Â 

The Designer Angular/React/Vue wrapper allows you to embed the component into your React/Angular/Vue framework easily.

### Customization
1. Create a command named "Welcome" and mount this command under the commandMap property of the config.  The key for CommandMap and the CustomCommand name are the same.
```js
let customCommand = {
	title: "Welcome",
	text: "Welcome",
	iconClass: "ribbon-button-welcome",
	bigButton: "true",
	commandName: "Welcome",
	execute: async (context, propertyName) => {
		alert('Welcome to new designer.');
	}
}
config.commandMap = {
	Welcome: customCommand
}
```

2. Find the location where you want your command to go, and add the Command name to the config.
For example, I've added a Welcome command in the ribbon before Undo, and the name of the command is 'Welcome'.
```js
{
    "label":"NewDesigner",
    "thumbnailClass":"welcome",
    "commandGroup":{
        "children":[
            {
                "direction":"vertical",
                "commands":[
                    "Welcome"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

3. Pass the custom Config into the Designer.
```js
var designer = new GC.Spread.Sheets.Designer.Designer(document.getElementById("hostDiv"), customConfig, spread);
```

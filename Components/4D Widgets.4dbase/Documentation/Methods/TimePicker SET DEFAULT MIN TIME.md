## Description

The TimePicker SET DEFAULT MIN TIME command is used to specify the minimum enterable time that will be allowed by default for all the TimePicker objects.

This setting is only taken into account for objects created subsequently and does not apply to any existing objects. If you want to apply it to existing objects, you must use the [TimePicker APPLY DEFAULT VALUES](TimePicker%20APPLY%20DEFAULT%20VALUES.md "TimePicker APPLY DEFAULT VALUES") command.

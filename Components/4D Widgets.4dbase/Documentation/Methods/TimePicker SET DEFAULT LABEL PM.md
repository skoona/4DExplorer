## Description

The [TimePicker SET LABEL PM](TimePicker%20SET%20LABEL%20PM.md "TimePicker SET LABEL PM") command is used to modify the default "PM" label in all the TimePicker objects displaying the AM/PM format.

This setting is only taken into account for objects created subsequently and does not apply to any existing objects. If you want to apply it to existing objects, you must use the [TimePicker APPLY DEFAULT VALUES](TimePicker%20APPLY%20DEFAULT%20VALUES.md "TimePicker APPLY DEFAULT VALUES") command.

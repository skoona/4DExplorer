# DatePicker RESET DEFAULT VALUES

> DatePicker RESET DEFAULT VALUES

## Description

The DatePicker RESET DEFAULT VALUES command resets the parameters of the DatePicker component to their "factory settings". After executing this component method:

* the minimum or maximum enterable dates are 00/00/00 (meaning there are no limits)
* the first day of the week is 2 (Monday)
* the weekly "days off" are Saturday and Sunday
* no yearly "days off" or specific holidays are set.

Note that this setting is only taken into account for calendars created subsequently and is not applied to any existing calendars. If you want to apply it to existing calendars, you must use the [DatePicker APPLY DEFAULT VALUES](DatePicker%20APPLY%20DEFAULT%20VALUES.md "DatePicker APPLY DEFAULT VALUES") component method.
